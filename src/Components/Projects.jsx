Project Rewild is a cornerstone initiative of Vansaarthi, established in 2020 by Yash Chaudhary and co-founders Vrund Chaudhary and Raj Prajapati. This project embodies a heartfelt commitment to wildlife preservation and environmental restoration, with a primary focus on the rehabilitation of lost and displaced animals.
<br /><br />
How It Began
<br /><br />
Project Rewild started humbly, offering free rescue services for birds, snakes, and various other animals in distress. With no financial barriers, the project quickly became a lifeline for wildlife in and around Shikha Dhansura, covering nearby cities such as Modasa, Bayad, and Demai.
<br /><br />
Core Mission
<br /><br />
The mission of Project Rewild is to restore balance to ecosystems by:<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Rescuing animals in need, including those injured or displaced.<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Providing temporary care for their rehabilitation.<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Releasing animals safely back into their natural habitats, ensuring they thrive in environments suited to their needs.<br />
    <br /><br />
Achievements<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Over 1,000 animals rescued and rehabilitated since 2020.<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Free rescue services have supported diverse species, including endangered and vulnerable ones.<br />
    ‚Ä¢    Partnerships with local communities to raise awareness about wildlife conservation and ethical practices.<br />
    <br /><br />
Future Vision<br /><br />

The ultimate goal of Project Rewild is to expand its reach, offering structured rehabilitation facilities for a greater number of species and integrating large-scale reforestation efforts to enhance natural habitats.<br /><br />

This project stands as a testament to Vansaarthi's unwavering dedication to creating a world where every animal, no matter how small or vulnerable, finds a safe haven. üå±ü¶Öüêç</pre>
